# Hey 👋 I'm Tomás

I design, build and operate infrastructure that just works, so teams can focus on what they're actually building.

Deep interest in platform engineering, site reliability, DevEx, and automation. Always happy to chat about Kubernetes, five-nines architecture, networking, infrastructure patterns, GitOps, or your favourite productivity hack.
